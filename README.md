# nlp-mlops-01
An MLOPs project based on the blogging series: https://www.ravirajag.dev/blog

Project goals:
- Implement an end-to-end lifecycle of MLOPs

High-quality modeling is not the project's current focus

Things I've done:
- Create data module and model using PyTorch Lightning (2.0.0)
- Monitor and model visualization using Weight and Biases
- Fetch configs from hydra
- Data Version Control with DVC
- Updating...

The blogging series are quite old and I'm using the newest (atm) libraries so there are tweaks there and then.
